                         We all have the inner strength to create a life we love.   However, in the midst of navigating challenges, it’s easy to lose sight of our personal power. Being no stranger to situations that have left me feeling lonely, not validated, and without a voice, I understand what it’s like to not recognize my own gifts. 
                    </div>
                    <div class = "m-2">
                         For me, having seen some traditional therapists who simply had the intention of “deconstructing my issues” and “putting me in a box” only served to perpetuate the negative self image I came in with. However, when I finally met someone that simply held a non-judgmental space where I could express myself fully, I began to reconnect. It was from that place that I felt empowered to rise above my challenges.

                    <div class = "m-2">
                         Being in a space where I felt supported inspired me to choose a career where I could offer that same support to others. I graduated from Adelphi University and have been in practice since 2005. Since then, I have  constantly been engaged in continuing education and now practice as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Substance Abuse Counselor, and Yoga Instructor, as well as a Certified Mental Health Integrative Medicine Provider.

                    <div class = "m-2">
                        My method in working with clients is simple: to create a safe & non-judgmental space for self expression where they can uncover and be empowered by their own unique strengths.  I believe that effective therapy is less about “fixing issues” and more of being an advocate for individuals to make proactive changes in their own lives.

                        Reach out and take the next step.  It is possible to create a life you love.
